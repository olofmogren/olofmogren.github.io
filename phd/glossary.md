* **Vector** - a sequence of numbers. If its length is two or three, these can be interpreted as coordinates in 2D or 3D. In higher dimensions they can still be interpreted as coordinates, but in high-dimensional space.

<a name="matrix"></a>
* **Matrix** - a grid/table of numbers. Can be seen as a sequence of vectors.

<a name="mlmodel"></a>
* **Machine learning model** - a structural view of a machine learning algorithm. Examples can be [*artificial neural networks*](ann) or other statistical models. In general, a model is trained by updating its internal parameters, which are often stored as matrices (see [matrix](#matrix)).

<a name="ann"></a>
* **Artificial neural network** - a class of [machine learning model](#mlmodel) lightly inspired by animal brains. This connectionist approach, where large models can be built using simple building blocks ((artificial neurons or units)[#artificialneuron], (layers)[#layer], (activation functions)[#activationfunction]). An artificial neural network can approximate any given continuous function to an arbitrary precision, provided that it has enough (units)[#artificialneuron].
