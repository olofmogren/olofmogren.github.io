Welcome to this week's Learning Machines seminar.

This seminar is a collaboration between RISE and Climate AI Nordics -- [climateainordics.com](https://climateainordics.com/).

**Title:** N/A

**Speaker:** Mar√≠a J. Molina, University of Maryland

**Abstract:** N/A

**About the speaker:** Professor Molina&#x27;s research focuses on the application of machine learning tools (e.g. neural networks) and numerical modeling systems (e.g. CESM) to answer pressing questions in the domains of climate and extremes. Examples of problems that she is tackling include extending Earth system prediction, understanding genesis of extremes, and uncovering multi-scale patterns in the climate system. Our research also strives to incorporate open-source software and data, accessible communication, and multi-discipline collaboration.

**Location:** This is an online seminar. Connect using Zoom.
