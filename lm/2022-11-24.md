Welcome to this week's Learning Machines seminar.

**Title:** 

**Speaker:** Viktor Larsson, LTH

**Abstract:** 

**About the speaker:** Viktor Larsson is an associate professor in the Mathematical Imaging Group at Lund University. He previously worked as a PostDoc and senior researcher at the Computer Vision and Geometry group lead by Marc Pollefeys at ETH Zurich. His research interests include robust estimation problems that appear in 3D computer vision (e.g. Structure-from-Motion, visual localization and SLAM). He is currently exploring how to best integrate deep learning with classical geometry-based pipelines. In particular, identifying and replacing hand-crafted heuristics or implicit assumptions with more data-driven alternatives.

**Location:** This is an online seminar. Connect using Zoom.
