Welcome to this week's Learning Machines seminar.

**Title:** How reliable is your regression model's uncertainty under real-world distribution shifts?

**Speaker:** Fredrik Gustafsson, Karolinska Institutet

**Abstract:** Regression is a fundamental machine learning task with many important applications within computer vision and other domains. In general, it entails predicting continuous targets from given inputs. Within medical imaging, accurate regression models have the potential to automate various tasks, helping to lower costs and improve patient outcomes. Such safety-critical deployment does however require reliable estimation of model uncertainty, also under the wide variety of distribution shifts that might be encountered in practice.
