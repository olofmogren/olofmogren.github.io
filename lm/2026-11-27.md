Welcome to this week's Learning Machines seminar.

**Title:** From structure from motion to structure from sound

**Speaker:** Kalle Åström, LTH, Lund University

**Abstract:** Within computer vision there has been intense developments on methods for the so called structure from motion problem or simultaneous localization and mapping during the last 40 years. It is also a research aree that until now, has not been completely engulfed by the deep learning revolution of the last decade. Many of the techniques developed for vision have been an inspiration for the so called structure from sound problem for audio. In this talk I will talk about the interplay between these two research fields of geometric understanding of audio and video and give examples of recent and ongoing research in our research group. This includes (i) our work on a structure from sound pipeline including minimal solvers, ransac, upgrade methods able to handle a broad range of cases (time-of-arrival, time-difference-of-arrival, constant offset time-difference-of-arrival), (ii) recent work on using machine learning to improve time-difference-of-arrival and (iii) ongoing work on feature-metric learning. In the talk I will also outline some of the use-cases for the developed methods, for example within biology research on bats and dolphins and sound based localization.

**About the speaker:** Kalle Åström is a professor at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences at Lund University. His research spans from basic research in algebraic geometry to applied mathematical research, machine learning, medical image analysis, computer vision and to dissemination in industry and society. His master&#x27;s thesis on autonomous vehicles was awarded first prize in Innovation Cup, 1991. The dissertation from 1996, won prize as best Nordic dissertation in machine learning and image analysis. He is the founder of several companies, Neuromathic, Spiideo, Cognimatics and Decuma, where Decuma won the EU&#x27;s &quot;IST grand prize&quot; in 2005. He has been main or co-supervisor for 35 PhD students.
