Welcome to this week's Learning Machines seminar.

**Title:** Reinforcement learning - theory, toy problems from Open AI Gym, and application examples

**Speaker:** Jonas Hellgren, RISE

**Abstract:** Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a paradigm of machine learning that focuses on training agents to make sequential decisions in an environment. This presentation, that is algorithm/math oriented, highlights the most essential concepts in RL. The concepts are needed to understand algorithm candidates for solving RL problems. The presentation also includes some toy-problems to increase the intuition of the concepts. Grid world and chart-pole are classical example toy problems. Real world applications are also presented.

The talk will cover the following concepts: Markov Decision Processes serve as the foundational framework for modeling RL problems. They define the key components: states, actions, transition probabilities, and rewards. Reward Functions: The reward function encapsulates the objective of an RL task, guiding the agent towards desirable outcomes. Value Functions: Value functions estimate the expected cumulative reward associated with a state or state-action pair, aiding in decision-making. Policy: The policy defines the agent's strategy for selecting actions in a given state, shaping its behavior. 

The following algorithms will be presented presented: Dynamic programming. Temporal Difference Learning: TD learning algorithms, such as Q-Learning and SARSA. Deep Q-Networks (DQN): Combining deep neural networks with Q-Learning enables the handling of complex, high-dimensional state spaces and has led to groundbreaking results in game playing and robotics. Policy-gradient methods.
