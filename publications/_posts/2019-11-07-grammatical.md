The grammatical gender of Swedish nouns is a mystery. While there are few rules that can indicate the genderwith some certainty, it does in general not depend on either meaning or the structure of the word. In this work wedemonstrate the surprising fact that grammatical gender for Swedish nouns can be predicted with high accuracyusing a recurrent neural network (RNN) working on the raw character sequence of the word, without using anycontextual information.
