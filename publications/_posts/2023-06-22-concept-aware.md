longversion: Decentralized deep learning requires dealing with non-iid data across
  clients, which may also change over time due to temporal shifts. While non-iid data
  has been extensively studied in distributed settings, temporal shifts have received
  no attention. To the best of our knowledge, we are first with tackling the novel
  and challenging problem of decentralized learning with non-iid and dynamic data.
  We propose a novel algorithm that can automatically discover and adapt to the evolving
  concepts in the network, without any prior knowledge or estimation of the number
  of concepts. We evaluate our algorithm on standard benchmark datasets and demonstrate
  that it outperforms previous methods for decentralized learning.
