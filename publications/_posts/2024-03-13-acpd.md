longversion: In this work we propose an audio recording segmentation method based
  on an adaptive change point detection (A-CPD) for machine guided weak label annotation
  of audio recording segments. The goal is to maximize the amount of information gained
  about the temporal activation's of the target sounds. For each unlabeled audio recording,
  we use a prediction model to derive a probability curve used to guide annotation.
  The prediction model is initially pre-trained on available annotated sound event
  data with classes that are disjoint from the classes in the unlabeled dataset. The
  prediction model then gradually adapts to the annotations provided by the annotator
  in an active learning loop. The queries used to guide the weak label annotator towards
  strong labels are derived using change point detection on these probabilities. We
  show that it is possible to derive strong labels of high quality even with a limited
  annotation budget, and show favorable results for A-CPD when compared to two baseline
  query strategies.
