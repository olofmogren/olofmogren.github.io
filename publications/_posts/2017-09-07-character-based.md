shortversion: "
Given a demo relation (a pair of word forms) and a query word, we devise a character-based
recurrent neural network architecture using three separate encoders and a decoder,
trained to predict the missing second form of the query word.
Our results show that the exact form can be predicted for English with an accuracy
of 94.7%. For Swedish, which has a more complex morphology with more inflectional
patterns for nouns and verbs, the accuracy is 89.3%."
longversion: "<p>We present a model for predicting word forms based on morphological relational
reasoning with analogies. While previous
work has explored tasks such as morphological inflection and reinflection, these
models rely on an explicit enumeration of morphological features, which may not
be available in all cases. To address the task of predicting a word form given a
demo relation (a pair of word forms) and a query word, we devise a character-based
recurrent neural network architecture using three separate encoders and a decoder.
We also investigate a multiclass learning setup, where the prediction of the relation
type label is used as an auxiliary task.
Our results show that the exact form can be predicted for English with an accuracy
of 94.7%. For Swedish, which has a more complex morphology with more inflectional
patterns for nouns and verbs, the accuracy is 89.3%. We also show that using
the auxiliary task of learning the relation type speeds up convergence and improves
the prediction accuracy for the word generation task.</p><h2>Source code</h2><p>The source code used for the experiments can be downloaded from <a href=\"https://github.com/olofmogren/char-rnn-wordrelations\">https://github.com/olofmogren/char-rnn-wordrelations</a>.</p>"
