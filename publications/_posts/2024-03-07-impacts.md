longversion: Land cover classification and change detection are two important applications
  of remote sensing and Earth observation (EO) that have benefited greatly from the
  advances of deep learning. Convolutional and transformer-based U-net models are
  the state-of-the-art architectures for these tasks, and their performances have
  been boosted by an increased availability of large-scale annotated EO datasets.
  However, the influence of different visual characteristics of the input EO data
  on a model's predictions is not well understood. In this work we systematically
  examine model sensitivities with respect to several color- and texture-based distortions
  on the input EO data during inference, given models that have been trained without
  such distortions. We conduct experiments with multiple state-of-the-art segmentation
  networks for land cover classification and show that they are in general more sensitive
  to texture than to color distortions. Beyond revealing intriguing characteristics
  of widely used land cover classification models, our results can also be used to
  guide the development of more robust models within the EO domain.
