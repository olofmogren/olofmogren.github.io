longversion: In this paper, we propose a novel approach for privacy-preserving node
  selection in personalized decentralized learning, which we refer to as Private Personalized
  Decentralized Learning (PPDL). Our method mitigates the risk of inference attacks
  through the use of secure aggregation while simultaneously enabling efficient identification
  of collaborators. This is achieved by leveraging adversarial multi-armed bandit
  optimization that exploits dependencies between the different arms. Through comprehensive
  experimentation on various benchmarks under label and covariate shift, we demonstrate
  that our privacy-preserving approach outperforms previous non-private methods in
  terms of model performance.
