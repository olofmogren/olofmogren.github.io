The decision threshold Ï„ is 0.5 (red line)."

In this report we present our method for the DCASE 2022 challenge on few-shot bioacoustic event detection. We use an ensemble
of prototypical neural networks with adaptive embedding functions
and show that both ensemble and adaptive embedding functions can
be used to improve results from an average F-score of 41.3% to an
average F-score of 60.0% on the validation dataset.
