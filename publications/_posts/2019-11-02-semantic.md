Our main objective is to facilitate fashion image analysis. We do this through semantic segmentation of fashion images, using both textural information and cues from shape and context, where target classes are clothing categories. Our main contributions are *state-of-the-art semantic segmentation of fashion images*, and *modest memory and GPU/CPU usage*.
