imgalt: "From left to right: the input image, the ground
truth segmentation, the predicted segmentation (ResNeXtFPN),
the prediction with CRF, and the incorrectly classi-
fied pixels (shown in black) for two top scoring test data
image predictions from refined Fashionista."
shortversion: "
We approach fashion image analysis through semantic segmentation of fashion images, using both textural information and cues from shape and context, where target classes are clothing categories. Our main contributions are <em>state-of-the-art semantic segmentation of fashion images</em> with <em>modest memory and compute requirements</em>.
