longversion: We propose an approach for named entity recognition in medical data, using a character-based deep bidirectional recurrent neural network. Such models can learn features and patterns based on the character sequence, and are not limited to a fixed vocabulary. This makes them very well suited for the NER task in the medical domain. Our experimental evaluation shows promising results, with a 60% improvement in F 1 score over the baseline, and our system generalizes well between different datasets.</p><h2>Dataset</h2><p>The dataset presented in this paper can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/olofmogren/biomedical-ner-data-swedish/">https://github.com/olofmogren/biomedical-ner-data-swedish/</a>.
