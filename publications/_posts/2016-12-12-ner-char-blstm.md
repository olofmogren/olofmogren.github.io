longversion:
shortversion: We propose a novel approach for named entity recognition in medical data, using a character-based deep bidirectional recurrent neural network. A character-based neural model can learn features and patterns based on the character sequence, and is not limited to a fixed vocabulary. This makes the model very well suited for the NER task in the medical domain. Our experimental evaluation shows promising results. </p><h2>Dataset</h2><p>The dataset presented in this paper can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/olofmogren/biomedical-ner-data-swedish">https://github.com/olofmogren/biomedical-ner-data-swedish</a>.
