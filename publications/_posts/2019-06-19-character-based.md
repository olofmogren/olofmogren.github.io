shortversion: "
We present a model for predicting inflected word forms based on morphological 
analogies. Previous work includes rule-based algorithms that
determine and copy affixes from one word to another, with limited
support for varying inflectional patterns. In related tasks such as 
morphological reinflection, the algorithm is provided with an explicit 
enumeration of morphological features which may not be available in all
cases. In contrast, our model is feature-free: instead of explicitly 
representing morphological features, the model is given a demo pair that
implicitly specifies a morphological relation (such as write:writes 
specifying infinitive:present). Given this demo relation and a query word
(e.g. watch), the model predicts the target word (e.g. watches).
To address this task, we devise a character-based recurrent neural network
architecture using three separate encoders and one decoder.
Our experimental evaluation on five different languages shows that
the exact form can be predicted with high accuracy, consistently beating 
the baseline methods. Particularly, for English the prediction accuracy 
is 95.60%. The solution is not limited to copying affixes from the
demo relation, but generalizes to words with varying inflectional
patterns, and can abstract away from the orthographic level to the level
of morphological forms.
