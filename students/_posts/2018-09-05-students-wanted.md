Skilled master students wanted for a number of different master thesis projects.

As a master thesis worker at RISE AI you will get supervision from some
of Sweden's best people in the field, and work on projects that are looking to advance
the cutting edge of current machine learning research.

You are expected to have a solid background in machine learning, mathematics,
statistics, and algorithms.
