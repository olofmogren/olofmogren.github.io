        <span class="bold">Abstract:</span>

Automatic summarization is the process of presenting the contents of written documents
in a short, comprehensive fashion. Many approaches have been proposed for this problem,
some of which extract content from the input documents (extractive methods), and others
that generate the language in the summary based on some representation of the document
contents (abstractive methods).
      </p>
      <p>
This thesis is concerned with extractive summarization in the multi-document setting,
and we define the problem as choosing the most informative sentences from the input
documents, while minimizing the redundancy in the summary. This definition calls for
a way of measuring the similarity between sentences that captures as much as possible
of the meaning. We present novel ways of measuring the similarity between sentences,
based on neural word embeddings and sentiment analysis. We also show that combining
multiple sentence similarity scores, by multiplicative aggregation, helps in the process of
creating better extractive summaries.
      </p>
      <p>
We also discuss the use of information extraction for improving the quality of automatic
summarization by providing ways of assessing the salience of information elements, as
well as helping with the fluency of the output and providing the temporal dimension.
Furthermore, we present graph-based algorithms for clustering words by co-occurrence,
and for summarizing short online user-reviews by computing bicliques. The biclique
algorithm provides a fast, simple algorithm for summarization in many e-commerce
settings.

<!--Automatic Multi-Document Summarization can be a helpful tool for people surging
        through many sources of information. It is also an exciting area of research,
        and the topic of this licentiate thesis proposal.
        This licentiate thesis will present my work on how to make summarization
        systems more aware of the semantics in the input text and discuss
        different ways of measuring semantic relatedness of textual units.//-->

      <h3>Paper II: Extractive Summarization by Aggregating Multiple Similarities</h3>
      <p>
         <span class="indent"><span class="bold">Comments:</span>
Many existing methods for extracting summaries rely on comparing the similarity of two sentences in some way.
In this paper, we present new ways of measuring this similarity, based on sentiment analysis and
continuous vector space representations, and show that combining these
together with similarity measures from existing methods, helps to create better summaries.
The finding is demonstrated with MULTSUM, a novel summarization method that uses
ideas from kernel methods to combine sentence similarity measures. Submodular
optimization is then used to produce summaries that take several different similarity measures into account.
Our method improves over the state-of-the-art on standard benchmark datasets;
it is also fast and scale to large document collections, and the results are statistically significant.</span>
