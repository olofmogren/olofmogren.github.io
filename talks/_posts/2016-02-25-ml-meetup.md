shortversion: Recurrent Neural Networks can model sequences of arbitrary lengths, and have been successfully applied to tasks such as language modelling, machine translation, sequence labelling, and sentiment analysis. In this this talk, I gave an overview of some ongoing research taking place in our group related to the technology. Firstly, a master thesis project in collaboration with the meetup host Findwise, concerning entity recognition in the medical domain in Swedish. Secondly, the effort to build a system to give useful feedback to users in a discussion forum.
