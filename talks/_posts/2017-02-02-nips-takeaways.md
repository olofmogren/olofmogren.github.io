shortversion: "Before the representation learning revolution, hand-crafted features were a prerequisite for a successful application of most machine learning algorithms. Just like learned features have been massively successful in many applications, some recent work has shown that you can also automate the learning algorithms themselves. In this talk, I'll cover some of the related ideas presented at this year's NIPS conference."
