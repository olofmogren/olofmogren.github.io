shortversion: "
In this talk, we went through some approaches where machine learning were utilized for particle-based simulations of physical systems. Emphasis were put on (Sanchez-Gonzalez, et.al., 2020), a solution that builds on graph neural networks. The approach is trained using data simulated from engineered simulators but shows results that are applicable to a number of different settings (specifically, three different kinds of substances are simulated in different environments).
