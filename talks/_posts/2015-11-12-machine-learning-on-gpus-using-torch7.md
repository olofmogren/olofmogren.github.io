shortversion: An introduction to GPU computing from the machine learning perspective. I presented a survey of three different libraries&#58; Theano, Torch, and Tensorflow. The first two libraries have backends both for CPUs and GPUs. TensorFlow has a more flexible backend, and also allows distributed computing on clusters. The talk also included a discussion about throughput and arithmetic intensity, inspired by Adam Coates lecture at the Deep Learning Summer School 2015.
