<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  Automatic summarization is the process of presenting the contents of written documents in a short, comprehensive fashion. Many approaches have been proposed for this problem, some of which extract content from the input documents (extractive methods), and others that generate the language in the summary based on some representation of the document contents (abstractive methods). </p>
<p>This thesis is concerned with extractive summarization in the multi-document setting, and we define the problem as choosing the most informative sentences from the input documents, while minimizing the redundancy in the summary. This definition calls for a way of measuring the similarity between sentences that captures as much as possible of the meaning. We present novel ways of measuring the similarity between sentences, based on neural word embeddings and sentiment analysis. We also show that combining multiple sentence similarity scores, by multiplicative aggregation, helps in the process of creating better extractive summaries. </p>
<p>We also discuss the use of information extraction for improving the quality of automatic summarization by providing ways of assessing the salience of information elements, as well as helping with the fluency of the output and providing the temporal dimension. Furthermore, we present graph-based algorithms for clustering words by co-occurrence, and for summarizing short online user-reviews by computing bicliques. The biclique algorithm provides a fast, simple algorithm for summarization in many e-commerce settings. </p>

<h2>Paper I: Extractive Summarization using Continuous Vector Space Models</h2>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> This is a workshop paper showing preliminary results on multi-document summarization with continuous vector space models for sentence representation. The experiments were performed on opinionated online user reviews.<br />
<strong>My contributions:</strong> I implemented the submodular optimization algorithm for sentence selection and created the setup for the experimental evaluation.<br />

<h2>Paper II: Extractive Summarization by Aggregating Multiple Similarities</h2>
<p><strong>Comments:</strong> Many existing methods for extracting summaries rely on comparing the similarity of two sentences in some way. In this paper, we present new ways of measuring this similarity, based on sentiment analysis and continuous vector space representations, and show that combining these together with similarity measures from existing methods, helps to create better summaries. The finding is demonstrated with MULTSUM, a novel summarization method that uses ideas from kernel methods to combine sentence similarity measures. Submodular optimization is then used to produce summaries that take several different similarity measures into account. Our method improves over the state-of-the-art on standard benchmark datasets; it is also fast and scale to large document collections, and the results are statistically significant.<br />
