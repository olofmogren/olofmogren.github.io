<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
I am a senior research scientist at RISE Research institutes of Sweden
and head of the <a href="/group/">deep learning research group</a>.
We run a number of applied research projects where state-of-the-art
techniques from machine learning transform application areas,
and let new application areas drive innovation to push the boundaries
of machine learning research.

I have a PhD in machine learning from Chalmers university of technology, my thesis is called <a href="/phd/">Representation learning for natural language (click for details)</a>.
I have worked on 
<a href="http://mogren.one/summarization/">summarization</a>, 
<a href="/publications/2016/assisting/">dialogue systems</a>,
adversarial training
(for <a href="/publications/2016/c-rnn-gan/">sequences</a>,
<a href="/publications/2020/adversarial/">data privacy</a>,
<a href="/publications/2020/privatespeech/">speech</a>),
<a href="/publications/2017character-based/">character-based RNNs</a>,
and 
<a href="/publications/2020/federated/">federated learning</a>.

I believe in the potential for AI to make the world a better place for us all,
which is why much of the research projects I run are motivated by environmental
or medical issues.
I like listenening to the <a href="http://thetalkingmachines.com/">Talking Machines podcast</a>.
</p><p>
I organize, and occasionally give <a href="/talks/">talks</a> in, our popular <a href="https://www.ri.se/en/education/learning-machines-seminars">Learning Machines seminar series</a> at RISE (and at other events).
<!--During 2016-2017, I was the organizer of a seminar series at the
machine learning research group at Chalmers. //-->
When I have time, I do enjoy writing code and perform experiments. <!-- Most of it is written in Python with Pytorch, and I also have experience with Tensorflow, Theano, and Lasagne.//-->
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~richajo/">Richard Johansson</a> and <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~dubhashi/">Devdatt Dubhashi</a> was my PhD supervisors.</p>

<p>Also see my licentiate thesis, titled <a href="/lic/">&quot;Multi-document summarization and semantic relatedness&quot;</a>,
and my master's thesis <a href="/networks/">Dynamics of geographical routing in small-world networks</a>.
</p>

<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>I am currently supervising two PhD candidates.
I frequently supervise master's students in their thesis work. See <a href="/group/">my research group page</a>
and the list of finished master student projects
 for more info.
I have taught many courses.</p>
<h3>Other things</h3>
<p>When not doing research or teaching, I am a long distance runner and the lucky father of two wonderful children.</p>
<h3>Short biography</h3>
<p>Olof Mogren is a senior researcher at RISE heading The Deep Learning Research Group. Olof has a PhD within computer science from Chalmers University of Technology, and is the organizer of RISE Learning Machines Seminars. Olof works on problems within applied AI where privacy, fairness, and efficiency is central. This includes work on federated learning, privacy-preserving representation learning, and generative adversarial netork for all data modalities, including natural language, images, and sound. Some of his ongoing projects include Digital Platform for Predictive Maintenance of District Heating Networks, Soundscape analysis using AI methods, The Federated Learning Testbed, The Swedish Medical Language Data Lab, and Smart Fire Detection.</p>
