<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
I am a senior research scientist at RISE Research institutes of Sweden
and head of the <a href="/group/">deep learning research group</a>.
We run a number of applied research projects where state-of-the-art
techniques from machine learning transform application areas,
and let new application areas drive innovation to push the boundaries
of machine learning research.

<p><img style="float: right;" src="/graphics/mogren-2018-julia-sjoberg.png" />
I have a PhD in machine learning from Chalmers university of technology, my thesis is called <a href="/phd/">Representation learning for natural language (click for details)</a>.
I have worked on 
<a href="http://mogren.one/summarization/">summarization</a>, 
<a href="/publications/2016/assisting/">dialogue systems</a>,
adversarial training
(for <a href="/publications/2016/c-rnn-gan/">sequences</a>,
<a href="/publications/2020/adversarial/">data privacy</a>,
<a href="/publications/2020/privatespeech/">speech</a>),
<a href="/publications/2017character-based/">character-based RNNs</a>,
and 
<a href="/publications/2020/federated/">federated learning</a>.

</p><p>
I believe in the potential for AI to make the world a better place for us all,
which is why much of the research projects I run are motivated by environmental
or medical issues.
I like listenening to the <a href="http://thetalkingmachines.com/">Talking Machines podcast</a>.
</p><p>
I organize, and occasionally give <a href="/talks/">talks</a> in, our popular <a href="https://www.ri.se/en/education/learning-machines-seminars">Learning Machines seminar series</a> at RISE (and at other events).
<!--During 2016-2017, I was the organizer of a seminar series at the
machine learning research group at Chalmers. //-->
When I have time, I do enjoy writing code and perform experiments. <!-- Most of it is written in Python with Pytorch, and I also have experience with Tensorflow, Theano, and Lasagne.//-->
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~richajo/">Richard Johansson</a> and <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~dubhashi/">Devdatt Dubhashi</a> was my PhD supervisors.</p>

<p>Also see my licentiate thesis, titled <a href="/lic/">&quot;Multi-document summarization and semantic relatedness&quot;</a>,
and my master's thesis <a href="/networks/">Dynamics of geographical routing in small-world networks</a>.
</p>

<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>I am currently supervising two PhD candidates.
I frequently supervise master's students in their thesis work. See <a href="/group/">my research group page</a>
and the list of finished master student projects
 for more info.
I have taught many courses.</p>
<h3>Other things</h3>
<p>When not doing research or teaching, I am a long distance runner and the lucky father of two wonderful children.</p>

<h3>Short biography</h3>
<p>Olof Mogren is the director of deep learning research at RISE, and the organizer of RISE Learning Machines Seminars. He holds a PhD degree from 2018 in Computer Science from Chalmers University of Technology (Sweden), with a thesis about deep representation learning. He has extensive experience in leading applied AI projects related to sustainability and environmental and health applications. His work includes federated learning, privacy-preserving representation learning, and generative adversarial networks for multiple data modalities, including images, sound, natural language, and other types of sensor inputs. Recent work includes applied research related to soundscape analysis and computer vision for biodiversity monitoring, efficient and distributed machine learning, uncertainty quantification, predictive maintenance of district heating networks, and smart fire detection using machine listening.</p>

<!-- <p>Senior researcher heading the deep learning research group. Olof has a PhD in computer science from Chalmers University of Technology, and is the organizer of RISE learning machines seminars. Olof works on problems within applied AI often related to environmental questions. His work includes federated learning, privacy-preserving representation learning, and generative adversarial networks for all data modalities, including natural language, images, and sound. Some of his ongoing projects include predictive maintenance of district heating networks, soundscape analysis using AI methods, the federated learning testbed, the Swedish medical language data lab, and smart fire detection using machine listening. </p> //-->
