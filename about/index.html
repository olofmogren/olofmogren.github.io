<h1>About me</h1>
<p><img style="float: right;" src="/graphics/mogren-mountain-whitebg-cropped-medium.jpg" /> I work as a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/lab/">machine learning research group</a> with problems related to data science and machine learning, using methods from deep learning and graphical models.</p>
<p>My Licentiate Thesis, titled &quot;Multi-Document Summarization and Semantic Relatedness&quot;, was defended on November 20th, 2015. <a href="/lic">Read more about this</a>. My master's thesis was about small-world network models in realistically geographical settings. <a href="/networks">Read more about this</a>.</p>
<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>During period four (March-May 2016), I  developed and taught a PhD course in <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/lab/courses/deep-learning/">Deep Learning</a>, together with <a href="http://www.kageback.se/">Mikael Kågebäck</a> and <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~frejohk/">Fredrik Johansson</a>.</p>
<p>The course covered some of the most important topics in the field, including convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks, unsupervised methods, and regularization techniques.</p>
<p>We used a &ldquo;flipped classroom&rdquo; approach, with  video lectures from some of the best researchers in the field, along with discussion sessions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/lab/courses/deep-learning/" title="Deep Learning Course Web Page, chalmers.se">Read more at the course web page.</a></p>
<p>I also supervise a number of <a href="/students">master students</a>.</p>

<p>I have also taught the following courses.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/lab/courses/algorithms-for-machine-learning-tda-231/">Algorithms for Machine Learning and Inference</a>.</li>
<li><a href="https://ai-course-tin172-dit410.github.io/">AI</a>
(specifically the parts about probabilistic methods, including probabilistic graphical models)</li>
<li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
<li>Data Structures</li>
<li>Algorithms 
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ptr/alg.html">basic course</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~huangch/course/advanced_algorithm_2015.html">advanced course</a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Other things</h3>
<p>My research is currently within the project Data-Driven Secure Bussiness Intelligence, grant IIS11-0089 from the Swedish Foundation for Strategic Research (SSF). We have a nice collaboration with representatives from the industry on problems related to natural language processing and inference. Recorded Future, Seal, and Findwise are some of the companies we have worked with.
<a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~ptr/">Peter Damaschke</a> and <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~dubhashi/">Devdatt Dubhashi</a> are my supervisors.</p>
<p>When not doing research or teaching, I am a long distance runner and the lucky father of two wonderful children.</p>
