<h1>About me</h1>
<p>
I am a senior research scientist at RISE Research institutes of Sweden
and head of <a href="https://dl-group.se">The Foundational and Applied Machine Learning for Earth Research Lab</a>.
We run a number of applied research projects where state-of-the-art
techniques from machine learning transform application areas,
and let new application areas drive innovation to push the boundaries
of machine learning research.

<p><img style="float: right;" src="/graphics/mogren-2018-julia-sjoberg.png" />
I have a PhD in machine learning from Chalmers university of technology, my thesis is called <a href="/phd/">Representation learning for natural language (click for details)</a>.
I have worked on 
<a href="http://mogren.one/summarization/">summarization</a>, 
<a href="/publications/2016/assisting/">dialogue systems</a>,
adversarial training
(for <a href="/publications/2016/c-rnn-gan/">sequences</a>,
<a href="/publications/2020/adversarial/">data privacy</a>,
<a href="/publications/2020/privatespeech/">speech</a>),
<a href="/publications/2017character-based/">character-based RNNs</a>,
and 
<a href="/publications/2020/federated/">federated learning</a>.


</p><p>
I am a co-PI of <a href="https://climes.se/">CLIMES, The Swedish Centre for Impacts of Climate Extremes</a>, and co-founder of <a href="https://climateainordics.com/">Climate AI Nordics</a>, an initiative tying together researchers in the Nordic countries working on problems related to climate change. CAIN will be a platform that enables researchers in this area to connect and collaborate more. Head  over to <a href="https://climateainordics.com/">climateainordics.com</a> and become a part of this initiative!
</p><p>
I believe in the potential for AI to make the world a better place for us all,
which is why much of the research projects I run are motivated by environmental.
</p><p>
I organize the popular <a href="https://www.ri.se/en/education/learning-machines-seminars">Learning Machines seminar series</a>.
<!--During 2016-2017, I was the organizer of a seminar series at the
machine learning research group at Chalmers. //-->
When I have time, I do enjoy writing code and perform experiments. <!-- Most of it is written in Python with Pytorch, and I also have experience with Tensorflow, Theano, and Lasagne.//-->
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~richajo/">Richard Johansson</a> and <a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~dubhashi/">Devdatt Dubhashi</a> was my PhD supervisors.</p>

<p>Also see my licentiate thesis, titled <a href="/lic/">&quot;Multi-document summarization and semantic relatedness&quot;</a>,
and my master's thesis <a href="/networks/">Dynamics of geographical routing in small-world networks</a>.
</p>

<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>I am currently supervising two PhD candidates.
I frequently supervise master's students in their thesis work. See <a href="/group/">my research group page</a>
and the list of finished master student projects
 for more info.
I have taught many courses.</p>
<h3>Other things</h3>
<p>When not doing research or teaching, I am a long distance runner and the lucky father of two wonderful children.</p>

<h3>Short biography</h3>
<p>Olof Mogren is the director of deep learning research at <a href="https://www.ri.se/en/ai-center">RISE</a>, co-founder of <a href="https://climateainordics.com/">Climate AI Nordics</a>, and co-PI for <a href="https://climes.se/">CLIMES, the Swedish Center for Impacts of Climate Extremes</a>. He obtained a <a href="/phd/">PhD</a> in machine learning from Chalmers University of Technology in 2018. He works on foundational and applied machine learning, particularly with applications in computer vision and soundscape analysis for climate change adaptation and environmental monitoring. Recent examples include applied research related to <a href="/publications/2024/from/">biodiversity</a> <a href="https://mogren.one/publications/2022/fewshot/">monitoring</a>, <a href="/publications/2024/efficient/">efficient and distributed machine learning</a>, <a href="/publications/2024/impacts/">remote sensing</a>, <a href="/publications/2023/dense-water-flow-intensity-prediction/">stream flow forecasting</a>, and <a href="/publications/2022/smartfiredetection/">smart fire detection using machine listening</a>.</p>
